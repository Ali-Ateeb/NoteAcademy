"""Match mark-scheme entries to the questions they mark.

For MCQ papers this is exact: the mark scheme is an answer grid keyed by question
number, so matching is a dictionary lookup and cannot go wrong.

For structured papers the mark scheme uses its own numbering, which *usually*
mirrors the question paper and sometimes does not — merged parts ('3(b)(i) and
(ii)'), renumbering, or an entry covering a range. Matching is therefore
deliberately conservative: exact matches are accepted, everything else is
reported as unmatched. An unmatched question is a question a human looks at; a
question silently attached to the wrong mark scheme is a question that teaches a
student the wrong thing.
